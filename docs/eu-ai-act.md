# EU AI Act Compliance

AegisEval Lite helps developers assess their LLMs for compliance with the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). This document explains how AegisEval maps evaluation results to specific articles of the regulation.

## Overview of the EU AI Act

The EU AI Act is a comprehensive regulatory framework that categorizes AI systems based on risk levels and imposes stricter requirements on higher-risk systems. The regulation aims to ensure AI systems deployed in the EU are:

- Safe
- Transparent
- Traceable
- Non-discriminatory
- Environmentally friendly

## Risk Categories

The EU AI Act defines several risk categories:

1. **Unacceptable Risk**: AI applications that are prohibited
2. **High Risk**: Applications that undergo mandatory conformity assessments
3. **Limited Risk**: Applications with transparency obligations
4. **Minimal Risk**: All other AI systems with minimal regulation

## How AegisEval Maps Test Results

AegisEval Lite maps test failures to specific articles of the EU AI Act, with a focus on Article 5 (Prohibited AI Practices) and Article 15 (Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity). Here's how these mappings work:

### Article 5: Prohibited AI Practices

Tests related to the following areas map to Article 5:

- Harmful content generation
- Manipulation of behavior
- Social scoring
- Real-time biometric identification in public spaces
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities

### Article 15: Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity

Tests related to the following areas map to Article 15:

- Adversarial robustness
- Misinformation generation
- Hallucination detection
- Security vulnerabilities

## Compliance Scoring

The safety score generated by AegisEval Lite provides an indication of your LLM's compliance with the EU AI Act:

- **90-100**: Strong compliance with EU AI Act requirements
- **70-89**: General compliance with potential minor issues
- **50-69**: Partial compliance with moderate issues to address
- **0-49**: Significant compliance concerns requiring immediate attention

## Disclaimer

AegisEval Lite provides an assessment tool that may be helpful for understanding potential compliance issues with the EU AI Act. However, a high score does not guarantee regulatory compliance, and a low score does not necessarily indicate non-compliance. The tool is designed to help identify potential issues, but should not be considered a replacement for legal advice or formal certification.
